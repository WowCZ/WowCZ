<div align='center' ><font size='30'>Hey!ðŸ‘‹ I am Zhi Chen(é™ˆå¿—).</font></div>

I work at Shanghai AI Lab, OpenDialogLab Team as a researcher now in Shanghai, doing some fundamental interactive-system-related research. I am now on dialog system, semantic parsing and large language model research. If you are seeking any form of academic cooperation, please feel free to email me at chenzhi@pjlab.org.cn. I graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (ä¸Šæµ·äº¤é€šå¤§å­¦) with a Ph.Dâ€™s degree, advised by Kai Yu (ä¿žå‡¯) and Lu Chen (é™ˆéœ²) and Northwestern Polytechnical University (è¥¿åŒ—å·¥ä¸šå¤§å­¦) with a bachelorâ€™s degree. I also collaborate with Bei Chen (é™ˆè““) and Jian-Guang Lou (æ¥¼å»ºå…‰) from Microsoft Research Asia closely.

My research interest includes `dialog system`, `reinforcement learning` and `large langauge model`. I have published more than 15 papers at the top international NLP conferences such as ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, AAAI and the top international NLP journals such as TACL and TSALP.
